# Pokemon-online-gift
A small gift for my husband, based on the work of CloseRange called 'PokemonOnline'. Start inside our neighborhood, read a few cute messages and discover what is hidden under the spider webs, before it comes into reality. (Future plan: to create bigger map able to move around the whole map.)
